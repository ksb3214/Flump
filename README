Flump - A talker

This is a talker I wrote back in the day when such things were popular, it's on github so I can experiment with a few CI tools and github in general.

The code appears to compile and work on Debian 8.

I've added a few junk files to git just because I wanted to get going with my primary task, but they are unlikely to get in the way.

Just incase you ocme across this and want to use it for whatever reason here's a quickstart...

./configure
make all

Create a mysql db for it with an associated user with the usual privs.
Import the shema files (I really hope they are up to date, it has been 12 years since this was last used)

back to the flump/ directory

./flump -c

Set it up, it'll save a ~/.flumprc file, or you can create it yourself from the sample provided.

then to kick it all off..

./flump

Then telnet or whatever your client of choice is (it works very well with TinyFugue) to whatever port you configured.

That's all folks, I'm sure you'll figure the rest out.

PS. The code isn't perfect, it is shockingly hard on DB usage, although with today's machines I imagine it'll barely register, but I think it's quite a cool little project, completely modular, you could turn it into a web server, MTA, etc just by writing new modules.
